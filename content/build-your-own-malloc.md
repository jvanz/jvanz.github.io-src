Some time ago I bought the The Linux Programming Interface, one of the best books I have bought.
One of the first chapters I read were about memory allocation. At the end of the chapter author offers some exercises to the reader.
Among them there is one more challenged. Implement the equivalent to the malloc and free functions. The challenge has been accepted!

First of all, this implementation has only study purposes. It is mean you SHOULD not start to implement your malloc and free functions.
Do not reinvent the wheel! The glibc are being improved for decades for many great guys. ;)

Theory
------

Before show the code, I will explain how and what I use to create my own memory allocator. For this, I assume that you have a background of how a process works
and its data, text, heap, stack segments. If you do not have this acknowledgement, I will give some references in the end of this post.

#### System calls

There are two system calls allows the program to increase the program break, `brk` and `sbrk`. The program break defines where is the end of process's data segment. It means if the program
increases the program break, memory is allocated. Otherwise, it is deallocating memory.  In my code I used only `sbrk`, this function has one parameter the amount of memory the program wants to
increase. If the program break has being increased successfully, a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory is returned. Otherwise, (void*) -1 is returned. In my code I do not use `brk`, I did
not feel need to used it. `brk` allows the program set the end of data segment to the pointer passed in the functions arguments. I think I do use this functions because my code do not decrease the
program break. Maybe in the future I implement this feature and use the `brk` system call.

#### Memory management

A linked list keeps all available memory block, let's call it `free_list`. Each element is composed of a header and
the available memory itself. The header contains two fields, the  memory block's size and a pointer to the next element
in the list. Therefore, when a mount of memory is requested a search in the list is performed looking for a memory block
with enough size to attempt the request. The algorithm follows the 'First fit' approach. It's means, the first memory
block found with enough size is split (if necessary) and returned a pointer to the memory to the caller. If any block
has enough size, the heap is increased and the new memory is returned.

When the user wants to free a pointer, another search in the `free_list` is performed. This time, looking for a memory
block next the to the block is being freed. If a block is find, the two blocks as merged into one. Otherwise, the block
is append in the list. The goal of merge nearly block is to avoid memory fragmentation. ;)

Code
----

Let's take a look in the code!

[gist:id=869420fb87353049d4d7,file=memory.h]

As you can see the header is pretty basic. There are just two functions, `memory_alloc` to allocate memory as `malloc`
and `memory_free` to deallocate memory as `free`.

[gist:id=869420fb87353049d4d7,file=memory.c]

It is all the magic. As you will see soon, all memory blocks are multiple of the header size. It's means the minimum
memory size allocated is the HEADER_SIZE * 2. It's done to facilitate the pointer arithmetic and avoid counting every
single byte. Let's look deeper in the code.
Let's begin if the `memory_alloc` function. When a amoung of memory is request the function the first
step is check if the `free_list` exists. If it is not, it is means it is the first request and the `free_list` should be
initialized.

The above source code is a simple sample program using the functions described before.
