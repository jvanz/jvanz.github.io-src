These days I was writing a solution for a challenge in the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and I
ended up writing a algorithm to walk through a tree structure. Nothing too special
but I decided to white an article about the algorithms we can use.

There are many types of tree out there. But to keep the simplicity, will not 
cover some aspects like balanced trees, add node, remove a node, delete a 
section of the tree, among other things. Let's focus how to walk through trees. 
In this article we will use the following tree structure in our examples:

### What's a tree?

Before see how to climb a tree, we need to define what is a tree in the first 
place.  We can say that a tree is kind of a graph. But we will not cover graphs 
in depth here. So, let's not been so pedantic and use a more simple definition. 
We can say that a tree is compose of bunch of nodes connected with a parent/children 
relationship. What's a node? Well, a node is a data structure with a value, and 
a list of children nodes.

A node in a tree may have none, one, two or many children nodes. In this article 
we will focus on binary tree. Which means that the nodes in our tree will have 
2 children nodes at most. As you can see in the tree shown before, no node has 
more than 2 children. 

In our example, the value of each node is a integer. But it can be anything, 
even another tree. This will vary depending of application. In our tree the node 
`33` is the root node. The root node is the node which has no parent, it's the 
topmost node. All the algorithms show in the article start in the root node. 
The nodes `5`, `18`, `36`, `39` and `49` are the leaf nodes.  Leaf nodes has not children. 


### Algorithms

The following section describe the 3 main ways you can visit the nodes in a tree. 
In each of the following subsection will you see an image where the number of the nodes represent the
visit order. Thus, number `1` is the first visit node, `2` the second, `3` the
third and so on. The names `preorder`, `inorder` and `posorder` came from the 
relative root position with respect to its subtrees.

#### Preorder traversal
![]({filename}/images/pre_order_tree.png)

Ok, let's start with the pre order traversal. In this algorithm, as the name
suggests, we visit the tree nodes in the following order: root, left, right. 
When we walk though a tree using the pre order traversal we fist visit the 
root node, the current node which we are sitting on. Then, we visit the node 
in the left and by consequence the whole sub tree. After that, we do the same 
with the right node and its sub tree. Considering our tree, the nodes would be 
visited in the following order: `33 15 10 5 20 18 47 38 36 39 51 49`.

A possible recursive pseudo code this algorithms is:

```
// preorder the root come before its subtrees
def preorder-traversal(root):
	if root == null:
		return
	visit(root)
	preorder-traversal(root.left)
	preorder-traversal(root.right)

```

#### Posorder traversal
![]({filename}/images/pos_order_tree.png)

When we walk though a tree using the pos order traversal we fist visit the
left, the right node and their sub tree and then the root node. If we run this 
algorithm using our tree as the input, the visit would be:
`5 10 18 20 15 36 39 38 49 51 47 33`

A possible recursive pseudo code this algorithms is:

```
// posorder the root come after its subtrees
def posorder-traversal(root):
	if root == null:
		return

	posorder-traversal(root.left)
	posorder-traversal(root.right)
	visit(root)

```

#### Inorder traversal
![]({filename}/images/in_order_tree.png)

When we walk though a tree using the in order traversal we fist visit the
left, the root and then right node and its sub tree. If we run this 
algorithm using our tree as the input, the visit would be:
`5 10 15 18 20 33 36 38 39 47 49 51`

A possible recursive pseudo code this algorithms is:

```
// inorder the root come between its subtrees
def inorder-traversal(root):
	if root == null:
		return

	inorder-traversal(root.left)
	visit(root)
	inorder-traversal(root.right)

```

### Level order traversal
![]({filename}/images/level_order_tree.png)

Different from the previous traversals this algorithm does not walk though the
tree following the children nodes. It walk though the tree by level. This means that
all the node in the same level as visit before move to the next level in the tree.
Still using our tree as input example, this is the output: `33 15 47 10 20 38 51 5 18 36 39 49`

I would say we can consider that level order traversal a variation of the preorder
algorithm. The difference here is that we will use an auxiliary queue to visit 
the node. But it will continue visiting the nodes in the preorder. Take a look
in the pseudo code here:

```
def level-order(root):
	queue q;
	q.push(root)
	while (q is not empty):
		visit(q.top)
		q.push(q.top.left)
		q.push(q.top.right)
		q.pop()
```

Just a quick note. Remember, a tree is a graph. Thus, we can consider the level 
order traversal as a [breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search). 
The previous algorithms (`preorder`, `posorder` and `inorder`) are [depth first 
search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search). Because they go as 
depth as possible first. ;-)

### Vertical order traversal

The vertical order traversal, differently from the previous traversals and as 
the name suggests, walk through our tree in a vertical order. This means that, 
instead of visiting all the left, root or right node first, it visit all the nodes in 
the same horizontal distance from the root. 

#### Horizontal distance

The horizontal distance (HD) of a node in the tree is the distance from the root
node following this rules:

- The HD of the root node is 0;
- When move to a node in the left, subtract one (-1) from the distance;
- When move to a node in the right, add one (+1) from the distance;

Let's take a look in the HD for each node from the previous tree:
![]({filename}/images/horizontal_distance_values_tree.png)

Coming back to our example tree and considering that we are using a 
`preorder` algorithm. This means that our tree will be visit in the following order:

```
5		// HD -3
10		// HD -2
15 18 36	// HD -1
33 20 38	// HD 0
47 39 49	// HD 1
51		// HD 2
```

Again, a pseudo code can be:


##### That's all for now!

As always if you saw something wrong or know how to improve the article. Please,
let me know. Thanks!

I have some simple implementation of this algorithms in my sandbox [repository](https://github.com/jvanz/algorithms).
If you're interested in C++ and a real implementation of these algorithms, 
you are welcome to check it out. It's not something to be used in production, 
but you can take a look and show me if I'm doing something wrong! :)
